# My-Weatherboard

AS A traveler  
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities  
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly  

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs  
WHEN I search for a city  
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history  
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city  
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index  
WHEN I view the UV index  
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe  
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city  
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity  
WHEN I click on a city in the search history  
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
